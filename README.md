## ðŸ”¥News

- **[May. 2025]**: Our code and dataset have been released!

## Method

![Method](assets/Method.png)

### Stage I: Perception

* Extract Image Description
* Summarize Keywords
  
Please run the [LAD](LAD_code.ipynb) (Stage I) code.

### Stage IIï¼šSearch

* Construct Search Questions
* Self-judge
* ModelSearch
* WebSearch
* Rank
* Summary

Please run the [LAD](LAD_code.ipynb) (Stage II) code.

*Note: To setup WebSearch, please refer to [LAD-WebSearch](LAD-WebSearch/README.md) for more details.*

### Stage IIIï¼šReasoning

* Construct Reasoning Format
* Explicit Reasoning

Please run the [LAD](LAD_code.ipynb) (Stage III) code.

### LAD Pipeline

To get a clear understanding of the LAD pipeline, we provide a simple example code to illustrate the process. Please refer to the [LAD_pipeline_example](LAD_pipeline_example.py) for more details.

## Evaluation

Our evaluation utilizes two comprehensive image implication benchmarks, [II-Bench](https://github.com/II-Bench/II-Bench) and [CII-Bench](https://github.com/MING-ZCH/CII-Bench), both featuring **Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)**. 
Furthermore, we manually construct a high-quality benchmark by randomly selecting 50 images from varied image types like illustrations and comics. And we measure accuracy by comparing the model's selected option to the ground truth. 

Aware of potential MCQ biases and the greater difficulty of generation over judgment tasks, we introduce a novel evaluation method **Open-Style Question (OSQ)**. 
It uses the same images with the fixed question: "What is the implication in this image?". And we use GPT-4o with a specialized evaluation metric as evaluators, validated by multiple human consistency checks. 

### Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)

Our high-level benchmark includes diverse images such as comics, posters, illustrations, English and Chinese Internet memes, and Chinese traditional artworks, all rich in visual information and cultural significance. Each image is paired with one question, each offering six options with only one correct answer. The question is "What is the implication in this image?" (mostly) or different levels of image understanding, such as overarching interpretation and nuanced details.

### Open-Style Question (OSQ)

Our evaluation metric encompasses five key perspectives: ***Surface-level Information***, ***Emotional Expression***, ***Domain and Context***, ***Rhetorical Skills***, and ***Deep Implications***.
